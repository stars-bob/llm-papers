Abstract
Agent Skills are structured packages of procedural knowledge that augment LLM agents at inference time. Despite rapid
adoption, there is no standard way to measure whether they actually help. We present SKILLSBENCH, a benchmark of 86 tasks
across 11 domains paired with curated Skills and deterministic verifiers. Each task is evaluated under three conditions: no
Skills, curated Skills, and self-generated Skills. We test 7 agent-model configurations over 7,308 trajectories. Curated Skills
raise average pass rate by 16.2 percentage points (pp), but effects vary widely by domain (+4.5pp for Software Engineering to
+51.9pp for Healthcare) and 16 of 84 tasks show negative deltas. Self-generated Skills provide no benefit on average, showing
that models cannot reliably author the procedural knowledge they benefit from consuming. Focused Skills with 2–3 modules
outperform comprehensive documentation, and smaller models with Skills can match larger models without them. We publish
the dataset and evaluation harness to assist developers and researchers in future work at skillsbench.ai.

1. Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) have evolved from text gen-
erators into autonomous agents capable of executing com-
plex, multi-step tasks in real-world environments (Brown
et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023;
Ouyang et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022). This evolution is
exemplified by agent-centric CLI tools: Claude Code (An-
thropic, 2025b) from Anthropic, Gemini CLI (Google, 2025)
from Google, and Codex CLI (OpenAI, 2025) from OpenAI
enable developers to leverage frontier models as agentic
assistants within terminal environments. However, a fun-
damental tension exists: foundation models provide broad

capabilities but lack the procedural knowledge required for
domain-specific workflows, while fine-tuning is expensive
and sacrifices generality.
Agent Skills offer an emerging solution. A Skill is a struc-
tured package comprising instructions, code templates, re-
sources, and verification logic that augments agent behavior
at inference time without model modification (Anthropic,
2025a). Skills encode procedural knowledge: standard oper-
ating procedures, domain conventions, and task-specific
heuristics that guide agent behavior.
This modular ap-
proach builds on the options framework for temporal ab-
straction (Sutton et al., 1999) and cognitive architectures for
language agents (Sumers et al., 2023), mirroring successful
computing paradigms: foundation models provide base ca-
pabilities (analogous to CPUs), agent harnesses orchestrate
context and tools (operating systems), and Skills extend
competence to specialized domains (applications).
Skills ecosystems have grown rapidly, with community
repositories now hosting thousands of user-contributed
Skills spanning software engineering, data analysis, and en-
terprise workflows. Yet despite this proliferation, no bench-
mark systematically evaluates how and when Skills improve
agent performance, what content drives gains, or what de-
sign principles distinguish effective Skills from ineffective
ones. section illustrates this layered architecture and pre-
views our main result: curated Skills consistently improve
resolution rates across all 7 model-harness configurations,
while self-generated Skills provide negligible benefit. The
question is not whether adding task-relevant context helps,
but rather: How much do Skills help compared to baseline
augmentation? Which Skills components (instructions vs.
code vs. examples) contribute most? When do Skills fail
despite being present?
Existing agent benchmarks (Liu et al., 2023; Merrill et al.,
2026; Jimenez et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024b; Xie et al.,
2024; Koh et al., 2024; Trivedi et al., 2024; Yang et al.,
2023; Chan et al., 2025; Zhuo et al., 2025) evaluate raw
model capabilities in isolation, answering “How well can
this model perform task X?” but not “How much does Skills
Y improve performance on task X?” This gap has practical
consequences: practitioners cannot make informed deci-
sions about Skills adoption, and researchers lack empirical
grounding for Skills design principles.
To address this, we introduce SKILLSBENCH, the first
benchmark that treats Skills as first-class evaluation arti-
facts, with two core contributions:
1. A Skills-centric evaluation framework. We curate
84 tasks across 11 domains, each executed under three
conditions—no Skills, curated Skills, and self-generated
Skills—with deterministic verifiers and full trajectory
logging. We stratify tasks by difficulty and conduct leak-
age audits to ensure Skills provide guidance rather than
solutions.
2. Large-scale empirical evaluation. We evaluate 7 agent-
model configurations across 7,308 trajectories, produc-
ing the first systematic evidence on Skills efficacy, vari-
ance, and failure modes.
2. SKILLSBENCH
We present SKILLSBENCH, a benchmark for evaluating
the efficacy of Skills augmentation in LLM-based agents.
Built on the Harbor framework (Merrill et al., 2026; Harbor
Framework Team, 2026), each task adopts a containerized
structure with an environment that includes agent Skills
and related data, a deterministic verification test, and an
oracle solution. Following best practices for agentic bench-
marks (Zhu et al., 2025; Anthropic, 2026), we ensure strict
isolation and deterministic verification. Unlike Terminal-
Bench, which evaluates raw model and agent harness ca-
pability, SKILLSBENCH introduces a key methodological
difference: we evaluate every task under both vanilla (no
Skills) and Skills-augmented conditions, enabling direct
measurement of Skills efficacy.
2.1. Skills Specification
A Skill is an artifact that satisfies four criteria:
• Procedural content: Contains how-to guidance (proce-
dures, workflows, SOPs), not factual retrieval
• Task-class applicability: Applies to a class of problems,
not a single instance
• Structured components: Includes a SKILL.md file plus
optional resources (scripts, templates, examples)
• Portability: Skills are soley based on file systems, so it’s
easy to edit, version, share, and be used across different
skills-compatible agent harnesses.
This definition explicitly excludes: system prompts (lack
structure and resources), few-shot examples (Brown et al.,
2020) (declarative, not procedural), RAG retrievals (Lewis
et al., 2020) (factual, not procedural), and tool documen-
tation (Schick et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024) (describes ca-
pabilities, not procedures). We acknowledge this boundary
is not absolute (for example, a StackOverflow answer may
blend factual and procedural content), but our criteria pro-
vide operational clarity for benchmark construction. We
highlight the distinguishing features of Skills compared to
other augmentation paradigms in Table 1.
In SKILLSBENCH, each Skill is a modular package located
in environment/skills/ containing: • SKILL.md:
Natural language instructions specifying how to approach
a class of tasks, i.e., workflows, standard operating proce-
dures, or domain conventions. • Resources: Executable
scripts, code templates, reference documentation, or worked

2.2. Task Specification
Each task in SKILLSBENCH is a self-contained module
comprising four components:
• Instruction. A human-readable task description specify-
ing the objective, input format, and expected output. We
write instructions to be solvable by a knowledgeable hu-
man without access to the paired Skills, though the Skills
may substantially reduce time-to-solution.
• Environment. A Docker container with task-specific data
files and a skills/ subdirectory containing modular
Skills packages. The container ensures reproducibility
through isolated dependencies and clean file system state.
• Solution. A reference implementation demonstrating the
task’s resolvability. This oracle validates that each task
has at least one correct solution path.
• Verifier. Deterministic test scripts with programmatic as-
sertions, including numeric tolerances where appropriate.
This ensures reproducible pass/fail determination with-
out LLM-as-a-judge variance, following execution-based
evaluation best practices (Wang et al., 2023b; Brown,
2025).
2.3. Dataset Construction
The expressive and flexible nature of Skills and our task
specifications enables broad coverage across diverse do-
mains and problem types such as .... To maximize this
diversity, we adopted a community-driven, open-source
contribution model: 105 contributors from both academia
and industry submitted 322 candidate tasks. We count sub-
missions that included the full task specification (instruc-
tion, environment, solution, and verifier), along with author-
assessed difficulty ratings. From this pool, we curated the
final SKILLSBENCH dataset.
2.4. Contributing Principles
Contributors must satisfy explicit requirements designed to
ensure task quality and prevent shortcuts:
Human-Authored Instructions.
Task instructions must
be written by humans, not generated by language models.
We enforce this because LLMs generated queries will be
confined by the distributions of LLMs, which are the subject
of our evaluations, and LLM-generated queries are most of
the time of low quality.
Skill Generality.
Skills must provide procedural guidance
for a class of tasks, not solutions to specific instances. In-
structions must not reference which Skills to use, meaning
agents must discover and apply Skills autonomously. This
ensures we measure genuine Skill utilization rather than
instruction-following.
Deterministic Verification.
All success criteria must be
testable through programmatic assertions. We target mini-
mal number of tests needed for verification, avoiding both
insufficient coverage and redundant test bloat that leads to
artifical low pass rates. Tests must include informative error
messages and use parametrization rather than duplication.
Automated Validation.
Each submission undergoes auto-
mated validation before human review:
• Structural
validation:
Required
files
present
(instruction.md,
task.toml,
solve.sh,
test_outputs.py), correct directory layout, valid
TOML/YAML syntax.
• Oracle execution: Reference solution must achieve 100%
test pass rate. Tasks with failing oracles are rejected.
• Instruction quality: Instruction must be human writ-
ten (we apply both human review and GPTZero review,
and we achieve human label on 100% of our tasks). We
also evaluate instructions by six criteria (explicit out-
put paths, structured requirements, success criteria, con-
straints listed, context-first ordering).
Human Review.
After automated checks pass, maintain-
ers conduct manual review evaluating five criteria: (1) data
validity: input data must reflect real-world complexity; syn-
thetic or toy data is rejected unless justified; (2) task real-
ism: scenarios must reflect realistic professional workflows
without artificial difficulty; (3) oracle quality: reference
solutions should match how domain experts would solve the
task; (4) Skill quality: Skills must be error-free, internally
consistent, and genuinely useful for similar tasks beyond
this benchmark; (5) anti-cheating: tasks must prevent short-
cut solutions (editing input data, extracting answers from
test files, exploiting verifier implementation). Reviewers
run benchmark experiments with and without Skills across
multiple agents to confirm each task provides meaningful
signal about Skill efficacy. Figure 2 provides an end-to-end
overview of the three-phase pipeline: benchmark construc-
tion, quality filtering, and evaluation.

Figure 2. SKILLSBENCH pipeline overview. Phase 1 (Benchmark Construction): We aggregate Skills from three sources—open-
source repositories (12,847), the Claude Code ecosystem (28,412), and corporate partners (5,891)—yielding 47,150 unique Skills after
deduplication. In parallel, 322 contributors submit 105 candidate tasks. Phase 2 (Quality Filtering): Each task undergoes automated
checks (structural validity, AI detection, leakage audit) and human review (data validity, task realism, oracle quality, Skill quality,
anti-cheating), producing 84 tasks spanning 11 domains. Phase 3 (Evaluation): Tasks are executed under three conditions (no Skills,
with curated Skills, self-generated Skills) across three commercial agent harnesses (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI). Deterministic
pytest verifiers produce pass/fail outcomes; 7 agent-model configurations yield 7,308 trajectories, with curated Skills providing
+12.66pp average improvement.

Leakage Prevention.
To prevent Skills from encoding
task-specific solutions, we enforce explicit authoring guide-
lines and conduct leakage audits. A Claude Code Agent
SDK-based validation agent runs in CI to detect potential
Skill-solution leakage; failed tasks are rejected. Skills must
NOT contain: task-specific filenames, paths, or identifiers;
exact command sequences that solve benchmark tasks; con-
stants, magic numbers, or values from task specifications;
references to specific test cases or expected outputs. Skills
must be applied to a class of tasks, not a single instance; pro-
vide procedural guidance (how to approach), not declarative
answers (what to output); and be authored independently of
benchmark specifications.

2.5. Benchmark Composition
SKILLSBENCH comprises 84 tasks across 11 domains, with
category distribution shown in Figure 3. We stratify tasks
by difficulty, measured by estimated completion time by
individuals whom we consider median specialists for the
tasks, without the assistance of AI tools. Original task
contributors provided human time estimates, reviewed by
an additional set of reviewers from the maintainers who are
experts in the same domain.

3. Experimental Setup
We evaluate three commercial agent harnesses on SKILLS-
BENCH across seven frontier models under three Skills con-
ditions, resulting in 7,308 valid trajectories. A trajectory
is valid when the agent passes, fails, or times out on a task
without infrastructure and runtime errors. Each trajectory is
one agent’s attempt at solving a single task under a specific
Skills condition.
3.1. Agent Harnesses
We evaluate three commercial-line agents:
Claude
Code (Anthropic, 2025b), Codex CLI (OpenAI, 2025), and
Gemini CLI (Google, 2025).
3.2. Models
We select seven frontier models: GPT-5.2 (OpenAI), Claude
Opus 4.5, Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude
Haiku 4.5 (Anthropic), Gemini 3 Pro, and Gemini 3 Flash
(Google). All models use temperature 0 for deterministic
sampling.
We evaluate each model using its compatible agent harness.
Claude Code runs with all four Claude models; Gemini
CLI runs with Gemini models; Codex CLI runs with GPT-
5.2. This yields 7 model-harness configurations. The full
configuration matrix is in Table 7.
3.3. Skills Conditions
We evaluate each task under three conditions:
• No Skills: Agent receives only instruction.md, no
Skills present in environment.
• With Skills: Complete environment/skills/ di-
rectory with all examples, code snippets, and resources.
• Self-Generated Skills: No Skills provided, but the agent
is prompted to generate relevant procedural knowledge
before solving the task. This isolates the impact of LLMs’
latent domain knowledge.
The self-generated condition is evaluated on 5 of 7 configu-
rations (all Claude Code models and Codex); Gemini CLI
does not support this condition.
3.4. Evaluation Protocol
We provide Skills as system-level context preceding the task
instruction in SKILLSBENCH. We list the injection format
and context management details in Appendix E. For each
condition, the agent interacts with the containerized envi-
ronment until task completion, timeout, or round limit. The
verifier then executes deterministic assertions to produce a
binary pass/fail outcome.
3.5. Metrics
Pass Rate.
The primary metric is pass rate, following
the scoring methodology of Terminal-Bench (Merrill et al.,
2026): for each task, we average the binary reward across
5 trials, then average these task-level scores using a fixed
denominator of 84 (the number of evaluated tasks). Nor-
malized Gain. Following Hake’s formulation from physics
education research (Hake, 1998), we define normalized gain
as:
g = passskill −passvanilla
1 −passvanilla
(1)
Interpreting Normalized Gain.
Normalized gain has
known limitations: a model scoring 90% vanilla and 95%
with Skills yields g = 0.5, identical to a model scoring 10%
and 55%. These represent different phenomena (ceiling
effects vs. genuine scaffolding). We report both absolute
improvement (∆) and normalized gain (g) to enable nu-
anced interpretation. High g with low ∆abs suggests ceiling
effects; high g with high ∆suggests substantial scaffolding.
We interpret the claim of “consistent scaffolding efficiency”
as similar proportional benefit, not identical absolute im-
provement.
4. Results
Our results are twofold: 1. main evaluation three Skills
conditions across 7 LLM–agent combinations on 84 tasks,
and 2. detailed analysis of Skills design factors including
quantity, complexity, and domain effects.
4.1. Experiment 1: Skills Efficacy Across LLM–Agent
Combinations
We evaluate how curated and self-generated Skills affect
agent performance across commercial model-harness config-
urations. We test each configuration under three conditions
on all 84 tasks: no Skills, with curated Skills, and with
self-generated Skills (where supported).
4.1.1. MAIN RESULTS
Table 3 presents pass rates across all three conditions for
each model-harness combination, ordered by with-Skills
performance.
Finding 1: Skills provide substantial but variable benefit.
Skills improve performance by +16.2pp on average across 7
model-harness configurations, but with high variance across
configurations (range: +13.6pp to +23.3pp). This variability
suggests that Skills efficacy depends strongly on the specific
agent-model combination, contradicting the assumption of
uniform Skills benefits.

Finding 2: Gemini CLI + Gemini 3 Flash achieves maxi-
mum performance.
The best-performing configuration is
Gemini CLI with Gemini 3 Flash, achieving 48.7% pass rate
with Skills. Notably, Claude Code with Opus 4.5 achieves
the highest improvement (+23.3pp), reflecting Claude
Code’s (Anthropic, 2025b) native Skills integration opti-
mized for the Agent Skills specification (Anthropic, 2025a).
Finding 3: Self-generated Skills provide negligible or
negative benefit.
When prompted to generate their own
procedural knowledge before solving tasks, models achieve
–1.3pp on average compared to the no-Skills baseline. Only
Opus 4.6 shows a modest improvement (+1.4pp); Codex
+ GPT-5.2 degrades substantially (–5.6pp), and remaining
models are flat or negative. This contrasts sharply with cu-
rated Skills (+16.2pp), demonstrating that effective Skills
require human-curated domain expertise that models can-
not reliably self-generate. Trajectory analysis reveals two
failure modes: (1) models identify that domain-specific
knowledge is needed but generate imprecise or incomplete
procedures (e.g., listing “use pandas for data processing”
without specific API patterns), and (2) for high domain–
knowledge tasks (manufacturing, financial), models often
fail to recognize the need for specialized Skills entirely,
attempting solutions with general-purpose approaches.
4.1.2. HARNESS-SPECIFIC RELIABILITY
Beyond Skills efficacy, we observe reliability differences
across commercial harnesses:
• Claude Code: Highest skills utilization rate; improve-
ments range from +13.9pp (Opus 4.6) to +23.3pp (Opus
4.5), with all Claude models consistently benefiting.
• Gemini CLI: Highest raw performance (Gemini 3 Flash
achieves 48.7% with Skills); improvements range from
+13.6pp to +17.4pp.
• Codex CLI: Competitive raw performance (44.7% with
Skills); frequently neglects provided Skills—agents ac-
knowledge Skills content but often implement solutions
independently.
4.1.3. DOMAIN-LEVEL ANALYSIS

upward, with Gemini 3 Flash and Claude Opus dominating the
with-Skills frontier. Cost positions in this figure reflect the evalua-
tion infrastructure’s pricing model. Trajectory analysis reveals that
Flash consumes 2.3× more input tokens per task than Pro (1.08M
vs. 0.47M), a compensatory strategy where the smaller model sub-
stitutes iterative exploration for reasoning depth. At official API
pricing ($0.50 vs. $2.00 per 1M input tokens), Flash’s 4× lower
per-token cost more than offsets this higher volume, making Flash
44% cheaper per task ($0.55 vs. $0.98).

mains requiring specialized procedural knowledge that is
underrepresented in model pretraining (e.g., clinical data
harmonization, manufacturing workflows) show the largest
improvements, whereas domains with strong pretraining
coverage benefit less from external procedural guidance.

to 88.6%), sales-pivot-analysis (+85.7pp),
flood-risk-analysis (+77.1pp), sec-financi
al-report (+74.3pp). These tasks involve specialized
procedural knowledge rarely covered in pretraining.
Skills hurt performance on some tasks.
Despite pos-
itive domain-level aggregates, 16 of 84 tasks show nega-
tive Skills deltas: taxonomy-tree-merge (–39.3pp),
energy-ac-optimal-power-flow (–14.3pp),
trend-anomaly-causal-inference (–12.9pp),
exoplanet-detection-period (–11.4pp). These
failures suggest Skills may introduce conflicting guidance
or unnecessary complexity for tasks models already handle
well.
4.2. Experiment 2: Skills Design Factors
To understand how Skills design affects efficacy, we analyze
the relationship between Skills quantity, complexity, and
performance.

optimal benefit.

Finding 5: 2–3 Skills are optimal; more Skills show

Table 5 presents performance strati-
fied by number of Skills provided per task. Tasks with 2–3
Skills show the largest improvement (+18.6pp), while 4+
Skills provide only +5.9pp benefit. This non-monotonic
relationship suggests that excessive Skills content creates
cognitive overhead or conflicting guidance.
4.2.2. SKILLS COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS

Finding 6: Moderate-length Skills outperform compre-

We present the effects of Skills documen-
tation complexity on performance in Table 6. Detailed
(+18.8pp) and compact (+17.1pp) Skills provide the largest
benefit, while comprehensive Skills actually hurt perfor-
mance (–2.9pp). This suggests that focused procedural
guidance is more effective than exhaustive documentation—
agents may struggle to extract relevant information from
lengthy Skills content, and overly elaborate Skills can con-
sume context budget without providing actionable guidance.
4.2.3. MODEL SCALE EFFECTS
We study the effects of the foundation models’ scale across
Claude model family (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku 4.5).
Finding 7: Smaller model + Skills can exceed larger
model without Skills.
Claude Haiku 4.5 with Skills
(27.7%) outperforms Haiku without Skills (11.0%) by
+16.7pp.
Meanwhile, Claude Opus 4.5 without Skills
achieves 22.0%. This demonstrates that Skills can partially
compensate for model capacity limitations on procedural
tasks.
5. Discussion
Skills close procedural gaps. Skills are most helpful when
success depends on concrete procedures and verifier-facing
details (steps, constraints, sanity checks), rather than broad
conceptual knowledge. We observe large gains on domains
with specialized workflows or brittle formats, and smaller
or negative effects when models already have strong priors
and the Skill adds overhead or conflicts.
Harnesses mediate Skills use. Skills efficacy depends
not only on Skills quality but also on how the harness
implements Skills. Some harnesses reliably retrieve and use
Skills, while others frequently acknowledge Skills content
but proceed without invoking them. Structured interfaces
can also introduce long-trajectory failure modes (e.g.,
format drift), reducing the influence of early-injected Skills.
This motivates evaluating Skills under multiple harnesses
rather than treating “with Skills” as a single condition.
Implications for Skills authoring. Our analysis suggests
that concise, stepwise guidance with at least one working
example is often more effective than exhaustive documen-
tation; overly long Skills definitions can increase context
burden without improving decisions. Modular Skills also
appear to compose better on multi-part tasks, and Skills
should explicitly match harness constraints (e.g., repeated
format reminders for JSON-only protocols).
5.1. Limitations and Future Work
Coverage and generalization. SKILLSBENCH focuses
on terminal-based, containerized tasks for reproducible
evaluation, so results may not directly transfer to GUI
agents, multi-agent coordination, or very long-horizon
workflows. We also evaluate a limited set of models and
7

harnesses; commercial harness behavior and Skills integra-
tion can change over time. A natural extension is to develop
multi-modal skills and protocols for vision-language agents
operating in GUI environments.
Causal attribution and controls. Skills injection increases
context length, so observed gains could partly reflect “more
context” rather than procedural structure. Our self-generated
Skills condition suggests structure matters—models can-
not reliably produce effective procedural guidance despite
having the same context budget—but future work requires
stronger length-matched baselines (e.g., random/irrelevant
text and retrieval-only documentation controls). These base-
lines also enable studying automatic Skills synthesis from
demonstrations or documentation and isolating which Skills
components (steps, examples, code resources) drive im-
provements.
Determinism, contamination, and ecological validity.
Containerization provides state isolation but not perfect
determinism or immunity to training-set leakage.
We
mitigate with multiple runs, a leakage audit (§2.4), and
paired (Skills vs. no Skills) comparisons, yet cannot
eliminate all nondeterminism or memorization effects.
Future work should evaluate ecosystem-representative
settings, including lower-quality and automatically-selected
Skills, and study Skills composition—when multiple Skills
help or interfere, and whether composite performance can
be predicted from atomic Skills effects.
6. Related Work
SKILLSBENCH connects to prior work on (1) benchmarking
LLM agents, (2) augmenting agents with procedural knowl-
edge and tools, and (3) evaluating improvements across
heterogeneous systems.
Agent benchmarks. Recent evaluate end-to-end agent
capability
across
realistic
environments,
including
Terminal-Bench (Merrill et al., 2026), SWE-bench and
follow-ons (Jimenez et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; 2025).
Broader environment coverage appears in AgentBench
and interactive/web/GUI settings (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou
et al., 2024b; Koh et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024). Other
suites emphasize tool-mediated workflows, interactive
execution feedback, or domain specialization (Yao et al.,
2025; Trivedi et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2023; Chan et al.,
2025; Zhang et al., 2024; Zhuo et al., 2025; Austin et al.,
2021; Ye et al., 2025). These benchmarks measure how
well a fixed agent completes tasks. SKILLSBENCH instead
measures augmentation efficacy via paired evaluation.
Procedural augmentation and tool use.
Prior work
augments agents with structured reasoning or external
knowledge, e.g., CoALA and Voyager (Sumers et al.,
2023; Wang et al., 2023a), chain-of-thought and ReAct for
multi-step problem solving (Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al.,
2023; 2022; Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhou
et al., 2023; 2024a), and retrieval/tool use (Lewis et al.,
2020; Zhou et al., 2022; Schick et al., 2023; Qin et al.,
2024), and declarative optimization frameworks (Khattab
et al., 2023). Skills combine procedural guidance with
executable resources (§2.1). Despite many augmentation
methods, benchmarks rarely quantify their actual impact.
Skills ecosystems and evaluation methodology.
An-
thropic’s Agent Skills and MCP specifications (Anthropic,
2025a; 2024) formalized skill packages and tool connec-
tivity, while agent CLIs (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and
Codex) provide real-world harnesses (Anthropic, 2025b;
Google, 2025; OpenAI, 2025). SKILLSBENCH evaluates
both commercial harnesses and a model-agnostic harness
based on Terminal-Bench (Merrill et al., 2026) to separate
model and harness effects. Finally, broader benchmark-
ing motivates careful reporting and comparability (Mattson
et al., 2020; Chiang et al., 2024; Srivastava et al., 2023); we
report both absolute gains and normalized gain (Hake, 1998)
to compare improvements across different baselines (§3.5).
7. Conclusion
We introduced SKILLSBENCH, the first benchmark to sys-
tematically evaluate Agent Skills as first-class artifacts.
Across 84 tasks, 7 agent-model configurations, and 7,308
trajectories under three conditions (no Skills, curated Skills,
self-generated Skills), our evaluation yields four key find-
ings: (1) curated Skills provide substantial but variable
benefit (+16.2 percentage points average, with high vari-
ance across domains and configurations); (2) self-generated
Skills provide negligible or negative benefit (–1.3pp av-
erage), demonstrating that effective Skills require human-
curated domain expertise; (3) less is more—focused Skills
with 2–3 modules outperform comprehensive documenta-
tion; and (4) Skills can partially substitute for model scale,
enabling smaller models to match larger ones on procedu-
ral tasks. These results establish that Skills efficacy is not
universal but context-dependent, motivating paired evalua-
tion as standard practice for agent augmentation research.
SKILLSBENCH provides both the empirical foundation and
open infrastructure for principled Skills design, selection,
and deployment.

A. Skill Ecosystem Analysis
To contextualize SKILLSBENCH within the broader landscape of agent augmentation, we analyze the existing ecosystem of
publicly available Skills.
A.1. Data Collection
We collected Skills from three sources:
• Public GitHub repositories tagged with “claude-skills” or “agent-skills” (N=12,847)
• Community marketplaces including Smithery.ai and skillmp.com (N=28,412)
• Corporate partner contributions (N=5,891)
After deduplication (based on SKILL.md content hash), we retained 47,150 unique Skills from 6,323 repositories.

Figure 5. Temporal dynamics of Skill creation over 136 days. Daily additions (bars, left axis) remained modest through late 2025, then
surged to a peak of 18,904 in January 2026. The cumulative curve (line, right axis) reflects exponential-like growth, reaching 84,192 total
Skills.
A.2. Skill Characteristics
Size Distribution.
Skill sizes follow a log-normal distribution with median 2.3 KB (IQR: 0.8–6.1 KB). The largest Skills
(top 1%) exceed 50 KB and typically include extensive code resources. Figure 6 shows the SKILL.md token distribution,
and Figure 7 shows total Skill size distribution.
Domain Coverage.
Skills span diverse domains (Figure 8):
• Software Development: 38% (git workflows, code review, testing)
• Data Analysis: 22% (pandas, SQL, visualization)
• DevOps/Infrastructure: 15% (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD)
• Writing/Documentation: 12% (technical writing, API docs)
• Other: 13% (scientific computing, finance, etc.)
Structural Patterns.
Most Skills (78%) follow the standard structure with SKILL.md plus optional resources. Figure 9
shows that most Skills contain very few files (median of one, concentrated below five). Figure 10 confirms the ecosystem is
documentation-heavy: markdown files dominate, followed by scripting and configuration code.
A.3. Quality Indicators
We developed a quality scoring rubric based on:
1. Completeness: Presence of required components (0–3 points)

Figure 6. Token distribution of SKILL.md files (n=36,338, 99.5th percentile shown). Most Skills are lightweight with median ∼1.5k
tokens.
2. Clarity: Readability and organization (0–3 points)
3. Specificity: Actionable vs. vague guidance (0–3 points)
4. Examples: Presence and quality of examples (0–3 points)
Mean quality score across the ecosystem is 6.2/12 (SD=2.8), indicating substantial room for improvement in Skill authoring
practices.
A.4. Implications for Benchmark Design
This ecosystem analysis directly informed SKILLSBENCH construction:
• Domain selection: Task categories mirror ecosystem coverage, ensuring Skills exist for evaluation
• Quality awareness: Ecosystem mean quality of 6.2/12 motivated our leakage audit and authoring guidelines—low-
quality Skills would confound efficacy measurement
• Skill selection: We selected benchmark Skills from the top quality quartile (score ≥9/12) to isolate the effect of
procedural knowledge from Skill quality variance
• Size constraints: Median Skill size (∼800 tokens) informed our 8K context budget allocation
Limitation: Benchmark vs. Ecosystem Gap.
Our 84 evaluated tasks with high-quality Skills represent an optimistic
scenario. Real-world Skill usage involves lower-quality Skills (ecosystem mean: 6.2/12 vs. benchmark mean: 10.1/12) and
imperfect Skill-task matching. Future work should evaluate with ecosystem-representative Skill samples.
B. Task Specification and Review Process
This appendix provides full details of the task specification format and quality control process summarized in §2.
B.1. Task Directory Structure
Each task is a self-contained directory with the following layout:
tasks/<task-id>/
instruction.md
# Task instructions for the agent

B.3. Verification Infrastructure
Verification uses pytest with the CTRF (Common Test Report Format) output. The test.sh script installs dependencies,
runs pytest, and writes a binary reward:
#!/bin/bash
pip3 install --break-system-packages pytest pytest-json-ctrf
mkdir -p /logs/verifier
pytest --ctrf /logs/verifier/ctrf.json \
/tests/test_outputs.py -rA -v
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
echo 1 > /logs/verifier/reward.txt
else
echo 0 > /logs/verifier/reward.txt
fi
exit 0
A task passes if and only if all assertions in test_outputs.py succeed (reward = 1). Partial credit is not awarded in the
main evaluation.
B.4. PR Review Process
Each submitted task undergoes a multi-stage review:
1. Automated CI: Structural validation (harbor tasks check), oracle execution (harbor run -a oracle,
must pass 100%), and AI-detection screening (GPTZero) on instruction.md.
2. Maintainer review: Evaluates data validity, task realism, oracle quality, Skill quality, and anti-cheating robustness.
Reviewers run benchmark experiments with and without Skills across multiple agents.

3. Benchmark report: For each task, reviewers produce a structured report documenting oracle results, agent pass rates
with and without Skills, failure analysis, and a final verdict (approve, major changes needed, or reject).
Of 322 candidate submissions from 105 contributors, 86 tasks passed all review stages and were included in the final
benchmark (26.7% acceptance rate).
B.5. Contributor Checklist
All task submissions must satisfy the following requirements before review:
□instruction.md is human-written (not model-generated); verified via GPTZero and human review
□Skills are error-free, factually correct, and generalizable to similar tasks
□Task is realistic and grounded in professional workflows
□Task requires domain knowledge and is significantly easier with Skills
□Outputs are deterministic and verifiable with programmatic assertions
□Test count is below 10 unless justified; tests cover distinct criteria
□Oracle solution passes 100% (harbor run -a oracle)
□Task tested with agent both with and without Skills
B.6. Maintainer Review Policy
Maintainers evaluate each submission against seven criteria:
1. AI detection: Verify instruction.md and task.toml are manually written using GPTZero and human review.
PRs with intentional grammar errors designed to circumvent AI detectors are closed.
2. Data quality: Data must be real-world and appropriately complex. AI-generated or toy data is rejected.
3. Task validity: Tasks must be grounded in realistic professional scenarios. Artificially inflated complexity is rejected.
4. Oracle quality: Simple solutions (e.g., an Excel formula or short script) are preferred over over-engineered oracle
implementations.
5. Author history: Authors flagged multiple times across PRs are closed automatically.
6. Test parsimony: Fewer than 10 test cases unless justified; tests should cover distinct criteria rather than repeat similar
checks.

Figure 10. File extension distribution. Markdown files dominate, indicating Skills prioritize natural-language instructions over executable
implementations.
7. Multimodal verification: For multimodal tasks (audio, PPTX, video, PDF), maintainers personally inspect agent
output to verify correctness beyond programmatic assertions.
B.7. Automated CI Pipeline
The CI pipeline performs the following checks on each PR:
• Structural validation (harbor tasks check): Verifies required files exist, TOML schema is valid, Dockerfile
builds, and test structure is correct.
• Oracle execution (harbor run -a oracle): Runs the oracle solution end-to-end and requires 100% test pass
rate.
• AI-detection screening: Runs GPTZero on instruction.md to flag potential model-generated content.
• LLM-backed quality checks: Automated verification of behavior consistency between instructions and tests, anti-
cheating measures, pinned dependency checks, typo detection, and hardcoded solution detection.
B.8. Benchmark Report Template
For each task, reviewers produce a structured report documenting:
1. Task metadata: Name, category, difficulty, tags, description, Skills provided, key requirements.
2. Oracle results: Pass/fail status, reward, tests passed, timing.
3. Agent results: Pass rates per agent-model combination, with and without Skills, including execution time.

4. Skills impact: Quantified comparison of with-Skills vs. without-Skills performance per agent.
5. Failure analysis: Per-test breakdown of failures including actual vs. expected output, root cause, and evidence from
trajectories.
6. Recommendation: One of: APPROVE, APPROVE WITH CAVEATS, MAJOR CHANGES NEEDED, or REJECT.
B.9. Review Lifecycle
PRs progress through a defined label-based lifecycle:
1. WIP →Need review: Author signals readiness for initial review.
2. Need review →Reviewing: A maintainer begins active review and benchmark experiments.
3. Reviewing →Change requested / Major change needed / Critical change needed: Issues identified; author must
address.
4. Change requested →Take another look: Author responds after changes.
5. Ready to merge →Good task: All reviews passed; task included in benchmark.
Critical changes include unrealistic task scenarios, AI-generated instructions, or synthetic data. Major changes include
incorrect tests, unreliable verifiers, or poor Skill quality requiring re-evaluation.
B.10. Task Quality Criteria
Tasks are evaluated against the following criteria:
• Realistic: Grounded in professional workflows that people in that domain actually perform
• Skill-dependent: Significantly easier with Skills than without—tasks solvable without any procedural guidance are
rejected
• Verifiable: Deterministic outputs testable with programmatic assertions; LLM-as-judge is not used
• Composable: Tasks should exercise 3–6 Skills together; instructions never reference which Skills to use
• Test parsimony: Fewer than 10 test cases unless justified; tests should cover distinct criteria rather than repeat similar
checks
C. Experimental Setup Details
This appendix provides full details of the experimental setup summarized in §3.
C.1. Model and Harness Configurations
Table 7 presents all 7 agent-model configurations evaluated in the main experiments.
Table 7. Agent harnesses and models evaluated. Total: 7,308 valid trajectories across 7 configurations and 3 conditions (no Skills, with
Skills, self-generated Skills). Self-generated condition evaluated on Claude Code and Codex configurations only.

C.2. Harness Descriptions
We evaluate three commercial agent harnesses:
• Claude Code (Anthropic, 2025b): Anthropic’s agent with native Skill integration
• Gemini CLI (Google, 2025): Google’s open-source terminal agent
18


--- Page 19 ---
SkillsBench: Benchmarking How Well Agent Skills Work Across Diverse Tasks
• Codex CLI (OpenAI, 2025): OpenAI’s lightweight coding agent
These tightly couple specific models with proprietary agent logic, representing real-world deployment conditions.
Model Family Consideration.
Claude models have been trained with awareness of the Agent Skills specification (An-
thropic, 2025a), which may confer advantages when processing Skill-formatted instructions.
C.3. Agent Interface
Agents interact with the environment through a standardized interface:
class BaseAgent(ABC):
@abstractmethod
def step(self, obs: str) -> str:
"""obs: terminal output -> action"""
pass
C.4. Skill Injection Mechanism
Skills are injected into each task’s Docker container by copying the environment/skills/ directory to agent-specific
paths. Each Dockerfile includes:
# Copy skills to agent-specific locations
COPY skills /root/.claude/skills
# Claude Code
COPY skills /root/.codex/skills
# Codex CLI
COPY skills /root/.gemini/skills
# Gemini CLI
COPY skills /root/.agents/skills
# Portable agents
Each agent harness discovers and loads Skills from its respective directory at runtime using its native skill scanning
mechanism. Claude Code and Codex read the SKILL.md frontmatter (name and description) to determine relevance;
Gemini CLI exposes an activate_skill tool that agents invoke explicitly. Instructions never reference which Skills to
use—agents must discover and apply them autonomously.
C.5. Skill Structure
Each Skill is a directory containing a required SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter and optional bundled resources:
skill-name/
SKILL.md
# Required: YAML frontmatter + instructions
scripts/
# Optional: executable code
references/
# Optional: reference documentation
The SKILL.md frontmatter specifies the Skill’s name and a one-line description used by agents for skill discovery. The
body contains procedural guidance, code examples, and usage patterns.
C.6. Self-Generated Skills Condition
For the self-generated condition, tasks are identical to the no-Skills baseline except that the following prompt is appended to
each instruction.md:
Important: Generate Skills First
Before attempting to solve this task, please follow these steps:
1. Analyze the task requirements and identify what domain knowledge, APIs, or techniques are needed.
2. Write 1–5 modular skill documents that would help solve this task. Each skill should: focus on a specific tool, library,
API, or technique; include installation/setup instructions if applicable; provide code examples and usage patterns; be
reusable for similar tasks.
3. Save each skill as a markdown file in the environment/skills/ directory with a descriptive name.
4. Then solve the task using the skills you created as reference.
19


--- Page 20 ---
SkillsBench: Benchmarking How Well Agent Skills Work Across Diverse Tasks
The environment/skills/ directory is empty at the start—agents must populate it before solving the task. No curated
Skills are provided. The self-generated condition is evaluated on Claude Code (all four models) and Codex (GPT-5.2) only;
Gemini CLI does not support this condition due to its explicit skill-activation interface.

C.8. Container Environment
All tasks run in Docker containers built from an ubuntu:24.04 base image. Per-task resource allocation is specified in
task.toml:
• CPUs: 1–4 cores (task-dependent)
• Memory: 2–10 GB (task-dependent)
• Storage: 10 GB (standard across all tasks)
• GPU: None (no tasks require GPU)
Containers are deleted after each trial (delete:
true) to ensure no state leaks between runs.
C.9. Inference Configuration
• Temperature: 0 (deterministic sampling)
• Max rounds: Level-dependent (10/30/50 for Core/Extended/Extreme)
• Context management: Sliding window with 8K token limit; oldest turns dropped when exceeded
• Timeout: Per-task, specified in task.toml (range: 600–1200s)
C.10. Experiment Orchestration
• Runs per task: 5 for main conditions (no Skills, with Skills); 3 for self-generated condition
• Concurrent trials: 256 (main conditions); 128 (self-generated)
• Retry policy: No retries for main conditions; up to 3 retries for self-generated (excluding VerifierTimeoutError,
BadRequestError, RateLimitError, AgentTimeoutError)
• Excluded tasks: mhc-layer-impl (GPU requirement) and fix-visual-stability (verifier timeout) are
excluded from all experiments
The evaluation comprises 7,308 valid trajectories across 7 configurations, 84 tasks, and 3 conditions. We report mean pass
rates with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals.
D. Task-Level Results
Figure 11, Figure 12, and Figure 13 show the task-level pass rates per model across all 84 evaluated tasks. Results are
averaged over 5 trials per task-model-condition combination. Tasks (rows) are sorted by average with-Skills pass rate;
models (columns) are sorted by aggregate with-Skills score.

E. Additional Experimental Details
E.1. Confidence Interval Calculation
We compute 95% confidence intervals using the percentile bootstrap method with 1,000 resamples. For normalized gain, we
compute CIs on the gain metric directly rather than on the component pass rates.
E.2. 10-Run Validation
For a subset of configurations (GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5, all 26 Extreme tasks, no-Skills and with-Skills conditions),
we conducted 10 runs instead of 5. Results show:
• Mean ∆within 1.2pp of 5-run estimates
• Standard error reduced by ∼30%
• All conclusions remain unchanged
This validates that 5 runs provides sufficient precision for our main findings.
F. Complete Task List
Table 9 enumerates all 86 tasks in SKILLSBENCH, organized by domain. Two tasks are excluded from evaluation:
mhc-layer-impl (requires GPU) and fix-visual-stability (verifier timeout), leaving 84 evaluated tasks.

G. Comprehensive Results Summary
Table 10 consolidates all aggregate results across 7 model-harness configurations and 3 Skills conditions. Scores are
computed using Method D (task-mean with fixed denominator of 84 evaluated tasks), consistent with Terminal-Bench (Merrill
et al., 2026) scoring methodology. Confidence intervals are 95% bootstrap CIs with 1,000 resamples.
Key observations.
• Curated Skills improve performance by +16.2pp on average (range: +13.6 to +23.3pp), corresponding to a normalized
gain of 21.5%.
• Claude Code + Opus 4.5 shows the largest absolute improvement (+23.3pp) and normalized gain (29.9%), reflecting
Claude Code’s native Skills integration.
• Gemini CLI + Gemini 3 Flash achieves the highest absolute pass rate (48.7%) with Skills, despite a smaller normalized
gain (25.3%).

H. Token Usage and Cost Efficiency
This section presents token usage statistics and cost analysis across all model-harness configurations. Token data is extracted
from trial result.json files where available.
H.1. API Pricing
Table 11 lists the API pricing used for cost calculations, verified as of February 2026.

Notes: Gemini 3 Pro uses tiered pricing ($2/$12 for ≤200K context; $4/$18 for >200K). GPT-5.2 offers cached input
at $0.175/MTok (90% discount). Anthropic batch API offers 50% off standard rates. Costs reported here use standard
non-cached, non-batch rates for consistency.
H.2. Token Usage by Model and Condition
Token counts are recorded at the harness level. Codex CLI and Gemini CLI record aggregate token usage in each trial’s
result.json (∼80–97% of trials have data); Claude Code does not record aggregate counts in result.json. For
Claude Code, per-call usage is available in session JSONL logs; however, the with-Skills condition JSONL files use a
different format that prevents recovery, and output token counts from JSONL are unreliable (capturing only a subset of API
calls). We report Claude Code data only where available and flag the data source.
Table 12 presents mean token usage per trial. Token usage includes both prompt (input) and completion (output) tokens.

H.4. Cost-Performance Tradeoff
The Pareto frontier analysis in Figure 4 (main paper) shows that Skills shift the cost-performance frontier upward across all
models. Key cost-efficiency findings:
• Gemini 3 Flash consumes 2.3× more input tokens per task than Gemini 3 Pro (1.08M vs. 0.47M with Skills), a
compensatory strategy where the smaller model substitutes iterative exploration for reasoning depth.
• At standard API pricing, Flash’s 4× lower per-token cost more than offsets higher token volume, making Flash 47%
cheaper per task ($0.57 vs. $1.06).
• Skills increase input token usage by 6–13% for Codex and Gemini (additional context from Skill documents), but the
performance improvement (+16.2pp average) substantially outweighs the marginal cost increase ($0.03–0.22 per trial).
• Gemini 3 Pro shows a slight decrease in token usage with Skills (–6%), suggesting Skills help Pro solve tasks more
efficiently, with fewer exploration rounds.
Cache efficiency.
All models show high cache hit rates: GPT-5.2 at 91–92%, Gemini 3 Pro at 75–76%, and Gemini 3
Flash at 63–67%. Claude Code models (from JSONL data where available) show >99% cache rates, reflecting aggressive
prompt caching. In practice, cached pricing reduces actual costs by 50–90% below the standard rates shown in Table 13.
I. Failure Analysis
This section presents a comprehensive failure analysis across 7,294 evaluated trajectories. We first catalog infrastructure
errors (§I.1), then develop a trajectory-level failure taxonomy (§I.2) adapted from the Multi-Agent System Taxonomy
28


--- Page 29 ---
SkillsBench: Benchmarking How Well Agent Skills Work Across Diverse Tasks
(MAST) (Pan et al., 2025) and the Terminal Agent Taxonomy (Merrill et al., 2026). We classify 5,171 agent failures into
five categories based on programmatic analysis of verifier test outputs and error metadata from each trial.
I.1. Infrastructure Error Summary
Table 14 summarizes non-agent errors encountered during evaluation. These are infrastructure-level failures unrelated to
agent capability.

VerifierTimeoutError (83 trials).
73 instances on fix-visual-stability (excluded from evaluation) and 10 on
react-performance-debugging. The verifier itself exceeds its timeout budget (300–450s), independent of agent
behavior. fix-visual-stability was excluded from all experiments due to consistent verifier failures across all
configurations.
RuntimeError (46 trials).
Dominated by a single task: scheduling-email-assistant (42 of 46), where the
Dockerfile creates symlinks for Google authentication credentials that don’t exist in the evaluation environment. The
remaining 4 errors are isolated Docker daemon failures (OCI cgroup timeouts, container name conflicts, image race
conditions).
AgentSetupTimeoutError (35 trials).
Exclusively in withskills-gemini-cli, affecting 14 tasks. Gemini CLI’s
agent initialization exceeds the 360-second setup timeout on certain task environments. This does not affect other harnesses.
I.2. Trajectory-Level Failure Taxonomy
We adapt the Terminal Agent Taxonomy (TAT) from Terminal-Bench (Merrill et al., 2026), which itself derives from
MAST (Pan et al., 2025), to classify agent failures on SkillsBench. Where Terminal-Bench uses LLM-as-judge (Docent
pipeline with GPT-5) for trajectory classification, we use programmatic analysis of structured test outputs (CTRF reports
and pytest logs) from the verifier, as our tasks produce deterministic, machine-verifiable results. We organize failures into
five high-level categories:
• Timeout: Agent exceeds its allocated execution time (AgentTimeoutError). These represent resource exhaustion
rather than logical errors—the agent may have been pursuing a viable strategy that simply could not complete within
the budget. Corresponds to TAT’s “Unaware of Termination Conditions” when the agent fails to prioritize within time
constraints.
• Execution: Agent produces incorrect or missing output due to implementation errors:
– No Output Produced: Required output files are absent (all verifier tests fail on file existence checks). Often caused
by early crashes, environmental setup failures, or the agent never reaching the output-generation stage.
– Specification Violation: Agent contradicts explicit task directives—e.g., producing hardcoded values instead
of required formulas, wrong output format, or violating structural constraints. Corresponds to TAT’s “Disobey
Specification.”
– Domain Knowledge Gap: Agent misinterprets domain-specific concepts—e.g., unit conversion errors, incorrect
scientific formulas, or misapplied domain algorithms.
– Incorrect Implementation: Correct approach but flawed logic—e.g., off-by-one errors, incorrect data transforma-
tions, or algorithm bugs.
– Tool/Environment Failure: Agent fails to install dependencies, handle permissions, or configure the execution
environment.
29


--- Page 30 ---
SkillsBench: Benchmarking How Well Agent Skills Work Across Diverse Tasks
• Coherence: Agent produces a partial but structurally sound solution:
– Incomplete Solution: Some verifier tests pass while others fail on missing components. The agent completes part
of the task correctly but leaves key deliverables unfinished. Corresponds to TAT’s “Premature Termination” when
the agent declares completion prematurely.
• Verification: Agent produces structurally complete output that fails quality thresholds:
– Quality Below Threshold: All required files exist and have correct structure, but computed values, metrics, or
outputs fall outside acceptable tolerances. This is the most common failure mode, reflecting the difficulty of
SkillsBench tasks even when agents understand the task structure. Corresponds to TAT’s “Weak Verification”
when the agent’s self-checks fail to catch quality issues.
• Unknown: Verifier output is absent or cannot be classified by our heuristics (4.4% of failures).
I.3. Overall Failure Distribution
Table 15 presents the distribution of failure modes across 5,171 agent failures (excluding 110 infrastructure errors). The
dominant failure mode is Quality Below Threshold (49.8%), indicating that agents typically understand the task structure
and produce output, but their solutions are insufficiently accurate. Agent Timeout is the second most common (17.8%),
followed by Incomplete Solution (10.2%) and No Output Produced (7.9%).

I.4. Failure Distribution by Model
Table 16 shows how failure modes vary across models. Key observations:
• Opus 4.6 has the highest timeout rate (29% of its failures) but the fewest Execution failures (10%), suggesting it
pursues more ambitious strategies that risk running out of time.
• Gemini 3 Flash/Pro have the lowest timeout rates (9–10%) but higher Execution failure rates (23–25%), indicating
faster but more error-prone execution.
• Haiku 4.5 has the highest Execution failure rate (21%) and highest overall failure rate (85.2% of trials), consistent
with its lower capability producing more fundamental errors.
• Verification failures are uniformly dominant across all models (48–53%), confirming that quality—not structure—is
the primary bottleneck.
I.5. Success Case Studies
We present representative examples where curated Skills transformed agent outcomes from failure to success, illustrating the
mechanisms through which procedural knowledge improves performance.
Skills bridge domain-specific API gaps: sales-pivot-analysis.
Without Skills, all 7 models scored 0% on this
task, which requires creating Excel pivot tables programmatically from population and income data. Agents consistently
loaded the data correctly but failed at pivot table creation—Codex attempted manual DataFrame reshaping instead of using

openpyxl’s pivot table API, producing structurally incorrect output (10/23 tests failed with “list index out of range” on
missing pivot objects). With Skills providing step-by-step guidance for the openpyxl pivot table workflow, 6 of 7 models
achieved ≥80% pass rate. Average improvement: +85.7pp.
Skills provide critical data processing pipelines: flood-risk-analysis.
This task requires identifying flood-risk
stations from USGS streamflow data using return period estimation. Without Skills, agents attempted ad-hoc statistical
approaches—e.g., simple threshold-based detection or incorrect distribution fitting—achieving only 2.9% pass rate. The
curated Skill specified the Log-Pearson Type III distribution, the standard USGS methodology for flood frequency analysis,
including the exact scipy function calls and parameter interpretation. With Skills, pass rate rose to 80.0% (+77.1pp), with all
models correctly applying the USGS-standard methodology.
Skills encode regulatory knowledge: sec-financial-report.
Analyzing hedge fund activities from SEC 13F
filings requires understanding specific regulatory formats, CIK lookup procedures, and filing comparison methodology.
Without Skills, no model could complete the task (0% pass rate)—agents either failed to locate the correct filings or
misinterpreted the tabular data format. The curated Skill documented the SEC EDGAR API endpoints, 13F-HR filing
structure, and cross-quarter comparison methodology. With Skills, pass rate reached 75.0% (+75.0pp).
Skills prevent common implementation pitfalls: manufacturing-fjsp-optimization.
The flexible job-shop
scheduling problem requires constraint-aware optimization with machine downtime windows. Without Skills, agents
produced naive schedules ignoring maintenance constraints (0% pass rate). The curated Skill outlined the constraint
propagation approach, objective function formulation, and OR-Tools solver configuration. With Skills, agents successfully
formulated and solved the optimization problem (68.6% pass rate, +68.6pp).
I.6. How Skills Change Failure Patterns
Comparing failure mode distributions between the No Skills and With Skills conditions reveals where Skills have the most
impact (Table 17).
Table 17. Failure mode distribution by condition (% of that condition’s agent failures). Skills reduce the overall failure rate from 78.4% to
61.1% while shifting the failure composition.

Skills primarily reduce Verification failures.
The absolute number of Quality Below Threshold failures drops from
1,184 (No Skills) to 819 (With Skills), a 30.8% reduction. This accounts for the majority of the improvement: Skills provide
domain-specific guidance that helps agents produce higher-quality outputs on tasks they already structurally understand.
Skills slightly increase the relative share of Timeouts.
While the absolute timeout count decreases from 367 to 328, its
share of failures increases from 16.1% to 18.6%. This is because Skills reduce easy failures faster than hard ones—agents
that previously produced low-quality output now spend longer pursuing better solutions, sometimes exceeding time limits.

SkillsBench: Benchmarking How Well Agent Skills Work Across Diverse Tasks
Skills reduce Coherence failures.
Incomplete Solution failures drop from 243 to 156 (35.8% reduction), indicating that
Skills help agents identify and complete all required deliverables rather than leaving components unfinished.
Self-Generated Skills underperform curated Skills.
The Self-Generated condition shows a higher failure rate (80.9%)
than No Skills (78.4%) with more Timeout failures (19.9%), suggesting that agents spend additional time generating and
then attempting to use self-authored Skills documents, which may contain errors or misleading guidance.
I.7. Qualitative Failure Examples
We present representative examples from each major failure mode, drawn from verifier test outputs across failed trajectories.
Quality Below Threshold: earthquake-plate-calculation.
The agent correctly identified the target earthquake
event, extracting latitude, longitude, magnitude, and timestamp accurately (7/8 tests passed). However, the computed
distance from the nearest plate boundary was 3,562 km instead of the expected 3,878 km—an 8.2% error that exceeded
the ±0.01 km tolerance. The agent applied the correct Haversine formula but used an incorrect plate boundary coordinate,
demonstrating that even when agents understand the computational method, domain-specific data interpretation remains
error-prone.
Agent Timeout: gravitational-wave-detection.
The agent was terminated by AgentTimeoutError be-
fore producing any output file. All 8 verifier tests were skipped after the file existence check failed. This task requires
processing LIGO strain data with signal processing pipelines (bandpass filtering, matched filtering, SNR calculation)—a
computationally intensive workflow that likely exceeded both the model’s reasoning and the execution time budget.
Incomplete Solution: shock-analysis-supply.
The agent created a structurally correct Excel workbook and
passed 6 of 9 tests, correctly setting up sheet structures, formula templates, and some data imports. However, it failed to: (1)
populate employment/labor data from the Penn World Tables (PWT), (2) execute the HP filter optimization solver, and (3)
compute the depreciation rate. These three missing components represent the most domain-specific and computationally
demanding aspects of the task.
No Output Produced: gh-repo-analytics.
All 8 verifier tests errored at the fixture stage with “Missing
/app/report.json,” meaning the agent never created the required output file. The task requires interacting with
a local Gitea server, cloning repositories, and computing analytics—a multi-step pipeline where failure at any early stage
prevents all downstream output.
Specification Violation: latex-formula-extraction.
The agent extracted LaTeX formulas from a PDF but
included markdown headers alongside the formulas in the output file, producing 6 entries instead of the required 5. The
specification required one formula per line wrapped in $$ delimiters; the extraneous headers violated this format constraint.
This failure illustrates agents’ tendency to over-include content rather than strictly adhering to output specifications.
Domain Knowledge Gap: exceltable-in-ppt.
The agent correctly updated the primary exchange rate cell in the
PowerPoint-embedded Excel table (6/8 tests passed) but failed to recompute inverse rates and dependent cells, producing
NaN propagation through the spreadsheet. The underlying issue was misunderstanding how Excel formula dependencies
cascade in embedded workbooks—a domain-specific detail that Skills could address.
Skills transforming outcomes: sales-pivot-analysis.
Without Skills, Codex populated source data correctly but
could not create Excel pivot tables (10/23 tests failed with “list index out of range” on missing pivot objects). With Skills,
all 23 tests passed—the Skills provided Office-specific guidance for programmatic pivot table creation that the agent could
not discover independently. This task exemplifies the 0% →85.7% improvement pattern, where Skills bridge a specific
capability gap.
I.8. Unsolved Tasks
16 of 84 evaluated tasks (19%) have a 0% pass rate across all models and conditions, revealing the current frontier of agent
capability. These tasks cluster into three patterns:

(6
tasks):
gravitational-wave-detection,
quantum-numerical-simulation,

exceed the agent’s time budget.
• Complex multi-step pipelines (6 tasks):
gh-repo-analytics, pedestrian-traffic-counting,
enterprise-information-search,

I.9. Tasks With Largest Skills Impact
Table 18 lists the 10 tasks where Skills produced the largest improvement in pass rate. These tasks share a common pattern:
they require domain-specific procedural knowledge (e.g., Excel pivot table APIs, financial modeling formulas, scientific data
processing pipelines) that is well-suited to being encoded in Skill documents. The average improvement for these top-10
tasks is +70.4 percentage points.

I.10. Agent Timeout Analysis
Agent timeouts (AgentTimeoutError) represent 17.8% of agent failures, affecting 922 trials across all configurations.
Unlike infrastructure errors, agent timeouts reflect the agent exceeding its allocated execution time.
Table 19. Agent timeout rates by model in the with-Skills condition (420 trials per model, 84 tasks × 5 trials). Effective rate includes
retroactive timeout enforcement for Gemini CLI (see §C).

Timeout concentration.
Timeouts are concentrated on specific tasks rather than spread uniformly.
Of 84 tasks,
39 (46%) have at least one timeout in the with-Skills condition.
Tasks such as taxonomy-tree-merge,
video-filler-word-remover, and gravitational-wave-detection consistently timeout across all models
(5/5 trials), suggesting these tasks exceed the computational budget regardless of model capability.

AgentTimeoutErrors (vs. 13% expected based on other configurations), indicating timeout enforcement was
disabled for these runs. We retroactively identified affected trials by comparing execution times to per-task timeout limits
derived from all observed AgentTimeoutErrors across configurations (see §C). Eight Gemini with-Skills trials that
scored reward > 0 were overridden to reward = 0, reducing Flash by 0.7pp and Pro by 0.7pp.
I.11. Data Cleaning: Gemini CLI Retry Irregularities
The withskills-gemini-cli configuration had retry irregularities: 13 tasks had more than the expected 10 trials (5
per model), and 64 launched jobs never completed (missing result.json). We cap at 5 trials per task-model (first 5
chronologically) and treat missing results as reward = 0. Six dropped valid trials had reward = 1.0 (see §C for details).
